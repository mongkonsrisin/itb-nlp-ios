# Problem
Image Classification is the task of assigning texts to input image. We need a lot of images to make a training data accurate, so we need a way to organize these image descriptions. So, I developed Android Application that help organizing images and descriptions. It also helps developers to add image descriptions without a computer.  

# APIs
I developed RESTFUL API in PHP language and use MySQL to store data.

# iOS Application
I developed iOS Application in XCode using Swift. I also use third party libraries to help loading images from server and connecting to HTTP easily. For loading images, I use SDWebImage (https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage). For connecting to HTTP, I use Alamofire (https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire).
